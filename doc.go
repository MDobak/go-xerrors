// Package xerrors is an idiomatic and lightweight Go package designed to
// enhance error handling in Go applications. It provides functions and types
// that simplify common error handling tasks by adding support for stack
// traces, combining multiple errors, and simplifying working with panics.
// The package maintains full compatibility with Go's standard error handling
// features (including changes in Go 1.13 and 1.20), such as errors.As,
// errors.Is, and errors.Unwrap.
