// Package xerrors is an idiomatic and lightweight package that
// provides a set of functions to make working with errors easier.
// It adds support for stack traces, [multierror]s, and simplifies
// working with wrapped errors and panics. The `go-xerrors` package
// is fully compatible with Go errors 1.13, supporting the
// `errors.As`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Unwrap` functions.
